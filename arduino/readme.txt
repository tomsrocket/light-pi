How to add a library to Arduino IDE:

Select "Sketch -> Import Library -> Add Library .."
Then Go into the directory where your library is a subdirectory. 
(eg go in the the directory where the subdirectory "FastLED_303" resides. Do NOT go into the directory FastLED_303!))
Single click the library subdirectory (eg. FastLED_303) (so that it is highlighted)
THEN click OK.  

=> This is the only way that works. Arduino IDE is very buggy!
